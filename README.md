If you'd like to contribute to Amango, here's what you need to do to get the app up and running:

Clone the repository and enter the directory: `git clone https://github.com/hum4n01d/Amango Amango; cd Amango`

Install the dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install` if you're a cool kid :wink:

Start the app: `npm start` or `yarn start`. 

If you want the Electron app to automatically reload when the main process (`main.js`) changes, run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
